# Polyorama design system and agent UI loop plan

Status: active; increment 5 landed; increment 6 implementation candidate

Baseline revision: `b8c66317aaa9284c45e712278010bc9cd285c01b`

Normative outcome: [design-agent-loop-goal.md](design-agent-loop-goal.md)

Reorientation budget: 200 lines. Detailed implementation, review and evidence
belong with the semantic owner or pull request rather than in this plan.

## Scope and authority

Deliver the complete design-system and agent-observable UI foundation without
new analytical capability or changes to the egui/wgpu substrate. Ordinary
code, tests, documentation and CI changes may land under standing repository
authority after exact-head independent review and successful gates. Release,
deployment, publication, breaking compatibility, rights or security-policy
changes remain human-review boundaries.

## Current phase

Increment 5 landed as PR #13 at merge `c1039b5`. A closed,
serialisable Rust catalogue owns 18 stable stories, including the required
button, dock, toolbar, property, status, virtual-grid and six composed
reference scenes. The app supports light/dark, standard/high contrast,
compact/comfortable density, 100/125/150% font scale and narrow/regular/wide
story surfaces without a runtime UI DSL. Gallery scenes call the production
dock and token-derived action, property, result, status and thumbnail recipes;
they use bounded deterministic fixture data and never materialise a logical
collection. A four-configuration representative matrix renders every story
headlessly with an empty measured-text audit. Browser WebGPU and native
GL/llvmpipe launch smokes retain manifests, Rust snapshots and selected
captures; the warmed browser frame counter remains stopped while idle.

Increment 6 implementation revision `87dcccd` makes action identity and
semantic inspection real. A closed `ActionId` registry now owns complete names,
descriptions, scope, shortcuts and stable serialisation for application,
viewport, annotation and result actions. Scope-aware targets feed the same
button, shortcut, AccessKit author ID, semantic node and physical smoke target;
the application continues to apply mutations through its existing validated
command and intent paths. Availability exposes enabled, disabled-with-reason or
hidden state from current authoritative state.

`UiSnapshot` is a bounded, serialisable current-frame observation with stable
IDs, roles, complete names, descriptions, geometry, state, pane/domain
references, actions, measured text and audit findings. Tabs, splitters,
viewports, visible result rows, visible thumbnail cells and representative
actions are included without materialising logical collections or creating a
second application tree. AccessKit parity tests cover names, descriptions,
disabled reasons, selection, actions and bounds; released `egui_kittest 0.36.1`
queries and activates registry actions against the existing egui 0.36.1 stack.
Native and browser physical smokes now locate representative controls by stable
action ID and current Rust geometry. Real dock rearrangement exposed and fixed
clipped off-surface nodes; all retained native/browser snapshots have empty
semantic audits.

The UI layer owns typed measured-text
roles, five explicit overflow policies, horizontal and vertical alignment,
bounded line counts, responsive pane classes, serialisable observations and a
deterministic one-point-tolerance audit. Dock tabs use egui galley measurement,
single-line ellipsis, full semantic names and stable geometry without the old
character-count width estimate. Application `TestSnapshot`/`UiGeometry`
exports eight bounded tab observations and the audit without enumerating
ordinary labels or virtualised collections.

The last landed canonical gate passes 125 tests, token drift, architecture,
native and Wasm clippy, release native/Wasm builds, browser WebGPU and native
GL/llvmpipe physical smokes. Increment 6 focused checks pass 44 UI, 26
application and five gallery tests plus workspace clippy, architecture, native
release, Wasm release and all four runtime smokes. Exact-head canonical
verification remains the candidate landing gate. Tooling/CI/guides remain
increment 7 and complete shell/content migration remains increment 8.

## Baseline evidence

- revision: `b8c66317aaa9284c45e712278010bc9cd285c01b`;
- `cargo xtask verify`: pass;
- tests: 83 pass (19 app, 32 core, 9 renderer, 14 runtime, 9 UI);
- release native build: pass;
- release Wasm application and worker build: pass;
- browser smoke: pass, WebGPU/WGPU, four render jobs, five completed workers;
- native smoke: pass, GL/llvmpipe at 1440×900;
- idle: browser warmed frame counter stopped and repaint reason was `None`;
- environment: cargo 1.97.1, rustc 1.97.1, Node 25.8.2, npm 11.11.1,
  wasm-bindgen 0.2.127, egui/eframe 0.36.1, wgpu 30.0.1;
- existing captures: [vertical-slice-evidence](vertical-slice-evidence).

Baseline verification overwrote several tracked evidence files with
run-dependent timings. Increment 3 corrected the canonical verifier to route
both physical smokes into an explicit ignored output directory; CI publication
of selected evidence remains increment 7.

## Audit findings

- The application has one partial `configure_style` function but no semantic
  tokens or component recipes.
- Seventeen static production UI colours remain outside generated scientific
  thumbnail data; typography and component geometry use scattered literals.
- Dock tab width used `title.len() * 7.2 + 22`; increment 3 replaces this
  violation with egui galley measurement and an architecture source check.
- At baseline, custom tabs, splitters, thumbnail cells and annotation controls
  exposed physical geometry but no explicit AccessKit metadata. Increment 4's
  candidate covers the dock tabs and splitters only.
- Standard buttons provide egui semantics, while keyboard routing is local and
  there is no action registry.
- `TestSnapshot` plus bounded `UiGeometry` is the correct cross-platform seed
  for the semantic snapshot; it must not become a second application model.
- Egui has AccessKit support, but the app's explicit eframe feature list does
  not currently enable the native adapter or web screen reader.
- `egui_kittest` is not locally cached or locked; compatibility must be probed
  against egui 0.36.1 without downgrading the stack.
- Existing physical smoke already targets current Rust-owned geometry for
  migrated controls; preserve that contract.

## Delivery graph

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Baseline, audit, goal and campaign control plane | — | Landed | PR #9, this plan and baseline gate |
| 2 | Visual language, token compiler, generated themes, preferences seed | 1 | Landed | PR #10, token tests, generated Rust, design language and [capture](design-agent-loop-evidence/README.md) |
| 3 | Measured text roles, overflow, observations and layout audit | 2 | Landed | PR #11, text fixtures, exported tab observations and empty audit |
| 4 | Reusable accessible shell components and keyboard focus | 2–3 | Landed | PR #12, 31 focused UI tests, AccessKit tree checks and native physical smoke |
| 5 | Native/browser gallery, stories and reference scenes | 3–4 | Landed | PR #13, 18-story manifest, matrix tests and selected gallery captures |
| 6 | Action registry and reusable semantic snapshot | 4–5 | Candidate; focused native/browser evidence passes | Registry, parity/kittest coverage and bounded semantic snapshots |
| 7 | `xtask ui`, snapshot artefacts, CI, guides and eval seed | 3–6 | Pending | CI runs and failure bundle probe |
| 8 | Full Analytical Workspace Lab migration and visual selection | 2–7 | Pending | Required capture matrix |
| 9 | Final performance/idle/native/browser hardening and report | 8 | Pending | Final report and canonical gate |

The graph may be refined only at phase boundaries when evidence reveals a
better coherent dependency boundary. Every increment must leave the workspace
buildable and relevant native/Wasm applications runnable.

## Evidence loop

After each material change:

1. run the smallest affected tests and native/Wasm build;
2. render affected deterministic stories;
3. inspect semantic and text-layout output;
4. inspect screenshots and visual diffs;
5. run relevant physical native/browser interaction checks;
6. record the exact revision and observed result with its semantic owner; and
7. select the next action from the strongest remaining failure.

Profile before architectural optimisation. Never adopt a changed baseline
until geometry, text observations and the responsible token/component source
show that the change is intentional.

## Next action

Commit the selected increment 6 evidence, run the complete exact-head gate,
independently review and repair the same head, then land it. Begin `xtask ui`,
snapshot artefacts, CI publication, agent guides and the evaluation seed only
after the semantic inspection contract is stable. Application-wide migration
remains deferred to increment 8.
