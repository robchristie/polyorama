# Design-agent loop evidence

This directory retains selected, reviewable campaign evidence. Generated test
runs remain outside the tracked tree unless a result is deliberately selected
and described here.

## Increment 2: token-driven application bar

`increment-2-token-application-bar.png`

- application source revision:
  `436ec422dc6220c24ed3515fcb012364125ea465`;
- captured: 29 August 2026;
- viewport: 1279×756 CSS pixels;
- application: release Wasm `analytical-workspace-lab`;
- browser: Chrome 151.0.7922.47 in a disposable Lantern session;
- backend: hardware WebGPU, `nvidia.com/gpu=0`, unsafe WebGPU explicitly enabled;
- result: nonblank scalar canvas, no Lantern layout finding, and the isolated
  application-bar recipe rendered without overlap or clipping;
- fresh follow-up navigation after the favicon correction: zero console
  messages, zero exceptions, zero failed requests and zero HTTP errors; and
- SHA-256:
  `5a83444f609d5cff0faebb019f8ed0d5885c36a644837870c8b414286acc78a8`.

The committed release Wasm output was produced by `cargo xtask verify` at the
source revision above. The exact capture sequence was:

```text
python3 -m http.server 4173 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory apps/analytical-workspace-lab/web
/nvme/development/lantern/target/release/lantern browser start --graphics webgpu --gpu-device nvidia.com/gpu=0 --json
/nvme/development/lantern/target/release/lantern flow --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:34247 --open http://host.docker.internal:4173/ --timeout-ms 30000 --quiet-ms 1000 --json
/nvme/development/lantern/target/release/lantern layout --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:34247 --json
/nvme/development/lantern/target/release/lantern screenshot --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:34247 --output docs/design-agent-loop-evidence/increment-2-token-application-bar.png --overwrite --json
```

The screenshot is supporting visual evidence. Token correctness and variant
coverage are established by generated-code, contrast, preference and compiler
tests rather than by this single dark/comfortable capture.

## Increment 3: measured dock-tab text

`increment-3-measured-tabs.png`

- application source revision:
  `7e21dc4cb42bed9c4249eab19a9cd580027df13e`;
- captured: 29 August 2026;
- viewport: 1279×756 CSS pixels;
- application: release Wasm `analytical-workspace-lab`;
- browser: Chrome 151.0.7922.47 in a disposable Lantern session;
- backend: hardware WebGPU, `nvidia.com/gpu=0`, unsafe WebGPU explicitly enabled;
- result: all eight dock-tab labels use egui galley measurement, remain centred
  and legible, and exhibit no overlap or accidental clipping;
- companion native and browser semantic smokes each exported eight bounded
  `TextLayoutObservation` values and zero text-audit findings;
- Lantern result: zero console messages, exceptions, failed requests, HTTP
  errors or layout findings; and
- SHA-256:
  `dfe76a31cd4e4250e470860fe172182e12af3ac2dbbed2deaf49554a7929f025`.

The exact source revision passed `cargo xtask verify`: 106 Rust tests, token
drift and architecture checks, native and Wasm lint/release builds, browser
WebGPU smoke and native GL/llvmpipe physical smoke. The screenshot is visual
support; truncation, alignment and bounds are established by the measured-text
fixtures, responsive dock tests and exported semantic observations.

## Increment 5: native/browser component gallery

The gallery implementation source revision is
`1e5dc9cf271fefc6a7066d7491f2fa1b9603328d`. The retained evidence was produced
from that implementation plus the same-branch evidence-metadata correction.

- `gallery-manifest.json` contains 18 unique typed story records;
- `gallery-browser-overview.png` shows the dark/standard/comfortable canonical
  dock reference at 1440×900 CSS pixels;
- `gallery-browser-high-contrast-narrow.png` shows the narrow diagnostics
  reference at light/high contrast, compact density and 150% font scale;
- `gallery-native-overview.png` shows the same application-shell story under
  native GL/llvmpipe at 1440×900;
- `gallery-browser-snapshot.json` and `gallery-native-snapshot.json` retain the
  Rust-owned story configuration, bounded geometry, text observations and
  empty audit result;
- `gallery-browser-evidence.json` records Chrome 151.0.7922.34, Playwright
  1.62.1, browser WebGPU via eframe/wgpu and unchanged warmed idle frame 14;
  and
- the native runtime/Xvfb logs retain the software-rendering environment and
  contain no panic or wgpu failure.

Exact capture commands were:

```text
cargo build --release -p polyorama-gallery
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p polyorama-gallery
wasm-bindgen --target web --out-dir apps/polyorama-gallery/web/pkg target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/polyorama_gallery.wasm
POLYORAMA_EVIDENCE_DIR=docs/design-agent-loop-evidence npm run gallery-browser-smoke
POLYORAMA_EVIDENCE_DIR=docs/design-agent-loop-evidence bash tools/gallery-native-smoke.sh
```

SHA-256 values:

```text
b1a8a04c5abed96a16b71ee3825fd4aa31b7f54180a33ccc41c3308c91188e34  gallery-browser-overview.png
2a6ef827dc9b5ef026bfc7bdaf4a2bb97a8d442b716f378fd398fc7746c9208e  gallery-browser-high-contrast-narrow.png
df7ea9140de4ade7ef83102b4108b3c301b0d868059364e9b8f13fdfa  gallery-native-overview.png
b974a5602eeaad62f00cf167128680d76ede60f4e06447d5c60b8d58131288b5  gallery-manifest.json
```

The screenshots support visual review. Catalogue invariants, all-story text
layout, component semantics, launch behaviour and idle repaint are established
by executable tests and the native/browser smoke assertions.
