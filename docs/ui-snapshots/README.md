# Deterministic UI snapshots

[`fixtures.json`](fixtures.json) is the versioned, closed fixture manifest for
Polyorama's selected visual, semantic and text baselines. Each fixture pins its
gallery story, viewport, data seed, appearance, contrast, density, font scale,
width class, bundled font set and browser-WebGPU renderer contract.

Build the browser package once, then use an explicit ignored output directory:

```sh
cargo xtask build-web
cargo xtask ui list --output-dir .tools/runtime/ui-list
cargo xtask ui render --fixture application-shell-dark --output-dir .tools/runtime/ui-render
cargo xtask ui inspect --fixture application-shell-dark --output-dir .tools/runtime/ui-inspect
cargo xtask ui audit-text --all --output-dir .tools/runtime/ui-audit
cargo xtask ui verify --output-dir .tools/runtime/ui-verify
```

Every command writes a versioned JSON `summary.json`; `list`, `render`,
`inspect` and `audit-text` retain their corresponding machine-readable
artefacts. `verify` compares pixels at zero tolerance and compares canonical
metadata, semantic snapshots and text observations structurally.

The verifier is deliberately read-only with respect to `expected/`. It has no
approval or update mode. A mismatch writes a fixture-specific bundle under
`<output>/failures/` containing expected and actual metadata, semantic, text
and visual artefacts, machine-readable diffs, a visual diff and capture logs.
CI invokes this same verifier through `cargo xtask verify` and uploads the
ignored verification evidence when a gate fails.

Baseline changes are ordinary reviewed source changes. Generate candidate
artefacts outside `expected/`, inspect every affected visual and semantic/text
diff, and copy only the deliberately accepted files into the checked-in tree.
CI must never perform that operation.
