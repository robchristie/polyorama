# Merged viewing qualification protocol

**Prepared only; no execution grant.** Main owns Git, review/landing, merged
revision/build selection and grants. One operation owner/watcher serialises the
final operations below. No builds, services, browsers, native/GPU launches or
timed measurements during preparation; do not monitor the running mask proof.
Completion-pump candidate removal at `3d0565f` restores the production behaviour
of `fe82f85984fba5c75d7a5a8f10b2d914b773a838`. No encoding/resource repair,
re-encoding, rate retuning, warmups, added retries or replacement observations.

## Identity freeze before main's grant

Resolve owners from the live
`/nvme/development/emuella/emuella-workspace/workspace.local.toml`; the acceptance
workspace's local configuration currently agrees. Configured roots are
`/nvme/development/emuella/{emuella-j2k,emuella-benchmark,emuella-testdata}`;
Polyorama's configured owner is `/nvme/development/polyorama`, distinct from this
task checkout. Main selects its merged checkout explicitly. Keep these revisions:

| Owner | Full revision |
| --- | --- |
| Codec | `6586e3d50f95429b242cb2e3535742b002784f2d` |
| Benchmark | `70eb3d1d9448f617333d658d9a60bb5b9439ecb2` |
| Testdata | `89a1681d6ed6900d057d09a87cb34a57f2a4f30c` |

Set `STORE` to the configured testdata owner's
`artifacts/rareplanes-expanded-v1`. Rights/source evidence is the workspace's
`docs/evidence/viewer-acceptance/source-coverage.json`, SHA-256
`9bba0a0ae9064fa6450ceb2b56263a6715b562e7aa7a5ab5cd1adf138ea117e8`.
Retain notice, attribution and lineage. Sources, services' writable files,
temporary files, profiles, captures and logs stay in fresh approved groups;
no acquisition, terms changes, protected deletion or outside copies. Register
build scratch beneath configured `.build-targets` as code-only.

After merge, rebuild from the clean merged commit using the commands and external
target-path requirements in [reproduction](real-scene-viewing-reproduction.md).
Build release `emuella-viewer` and `emuella-viewer-tools`, then
`cargo xtask build-viewer-web`; retain new `measured-bin` copies before canonical
verification. Never relabel historical binaries. Before running, main binds full
commit/tree, Cargo.lock/toolchain, linked codec, build commands, native/service
binary and every WASM/static-file SHA-256; harness/preload hashes; Chromium
executable/build, Playwright package/lock, Node, loaded libraries and graphics
loader/ICD/driver hashes. Bind launch environment/flags, display identity and
actual native 1440×900×24 and browser 1440×900 geometry/DPR. Observe actual hardware
adapter/backend during each run; NVIDIA history is not fresh hardware proof.
No software substitution; unavailable GPU timing remains unavailable.

Revalidate all five native full-source mask/reference receipts and their source,
representation manifest/payload/descriptor/mask and quality/reference hashes from
[full-scene results](viewer-acceptance-full-scenes-results.json), SHA-256
`37463f135f58b90c8916274c700da32d24523b10480ce36357a3ad21dfc24bd2`.
Representation roots are `$STORE/viewer-acceptance-full-scenes-NAME-01/representation`,
where NAME is each ordered result's `name`. Do not prepare or decode again.
Compare the full-scene native owner `4a1594b0840eadae26a4d6005d50d9201734a1a7`
against merged source: retain semantic tree comparison of reference, masks,
quality and service code plus linked codec. Separately compare the frozen viewing
runtime and mask-proof runtime to merged source. If review changes meaningful
runtime code, main evaluates evidence invalidation **before grant**; historical
runs retain their original revisions.

Pin unchanged workload/catalogue/threshold files by these SHA-256s:

| Input under `apps/emuella-viewer` | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `real-scene-workload.json` | `9c11bead76a2c556dd49c13164dd7a462aa01e325ed6d3fb03510054e17f50dd` |
| `development-catalogue.json` | `0ba9c081775b5f7663119ee86ccadd0c86e054175c9fbaa26f1f856ca9388680` |
| `validation-catalogue.json` | `b8720229f298c30b194233d1b5df58c30c09c0010c379c26c9febe2efdc757a9` |
| `qualification/real-scene-native-thresholds.json` | `ad6d9e596dbc9e2aa5142973433e7bb4b184498a98c4dd5123262305998e08d0` |
| `qualification/real-scene-browser-thresholds.json` | `5883523c3ed7cab87e55c5470e885ebd1abf2dd78b845a62d3304cc0ee0f12e8` |
| `qualification/real-scene-pressure-thresholds.json` | `cb1c1b16429413861024b0a5f68a0641f0eeae835e147ac1b7f2d761f208e18a` |

Tok retains its historical ordered two-source catalogue: RGB8 primary and
Mansfield RGB16 comparison-only auxiliary. The historical contract at
`$STORE/real-scene-viewing-viewer-tok-journeys-01/browser-01/catalogue-contract.json`
has SHA-256 `d49ef376ab76e22f6e12e1b43fff1aa948160e6239e58db055f215e09f0f324a`.
Copy those exact contract bytes into the fresh execution group after checking
both rows against the retained full-scene manifests. Serve Tok RGB8 4 first and
Mansfield RGB16 12 second: source hashes, bands and full geometries remain equal
to the historical contract. The auxiliary's diagnostic rate is the declared
current RGB16 12 configuration; record its actual representation identity.
No new regression source, singleton substitution, workload change or admission
exception is introduced. Historical Tok detail failures remain unresolved until
proved otherwise; one new observation is not a repeated performance comparison.

## Later bounded execution commands

Main creates a fresh group named
`viewer-acceptance-browser-masks-merged-IDENTITY-execution` under `STORE` (the prefix
is required by the existing alias validator; this is a new viewing operation).
Set `EXECUTION` to it, create `tmp` mode 0700 and approved `cache/config/data`
directories, and pin `alias.json` using the exact alias object in
[browser environment](viewer-acceptance-browser-environment.md), with fresh
backing dev/inode and invoking host mount namespace. Set
`VIEWER_MERGED_ALIAS=$EXECUTION/alias.json` and its observed SHA-256 in
`VIEWER_MERGED_ALIAS_SHA256`. The preload validates physical backing, effective
fdinfo mount ID, private propagation, no submounts and output/XDG placement before
Playwright import. Each invocation has one browser launch; recovery's three fresh
contexts remain inside that immutable namespace. It retains per-invocation
`temporary-alias.json`. No global mount or harness/benchmark alteration.
Main's owned native display must use that same approved temporary backing, so
its X11 socket remains reachable through the private alias; retain socket/lock
files and process lifecycle evidence. Do not borrow the mask-proof service/display.
Inherited Playwright transient cleanup is unchanged; retain all remaining files,
perform no additional deletion, and bind that lifecycle explicitly in main's grant.

From main's merged checkout, set `VIEWER_BUILD`, `CODEC_CHECKOUT`,
`BENCHMARK_CHECKOUT`, `URL`, approved display/library environment, and `BENCH` to
the existing `native-cohort-benchmark-v1/cargo/release/emuella-benchmark` beneath
configured `.build-targets/viewer-acceptance`; binary SHA-256
`af0685cdba760f1a56db162fcfd087a1e32781c1a784690d733d1ba4c8f98ab7`.
The following function is a later command template, not an invocation:

```sh
journey() (
  mode=$1 label=$2 contract=$3 cache=$4; shift 4
  export TMPDIR=/tmp XDG_CACHE_HOME="$EXECUTION/cache"
  export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$EXECUTION/config" XDG_DATA_HOME="$EXECUTION/data"
  unset NODE_OPTIONS
  if [ "$mode" != native ]; then
    export VIEWER_MERGED_ALIAS VIEWER_MERGED_ALIAS_SHA256
    export NODE_OPTIONS="--import=$PWD/tools/viewer-merged-qualification-preload.mjs"
  fi
  code=0
  unshare -Urm --propagation private sh -eu -c '
    mount --bind "$1/tmp" /tmp; shift; exec "$@"
  ' merged-viewing "$EXECUTION" python3 tools/viewer-composed-journey.py \
    --mode "$mode" --output "$EXECUTION/$label" --url "$URL" \
    --native-bin "$VIEWER_BUILD/measured-bin/emuella-viewer" \
    --web-root "$VIEWER_BUILD/web" --codec-repo "$CODEC_CHECKOUT" \
    --benchmark-repo "$BENCHMARK_CHECKOUT" --server-cache-state "$cache" \
    --catalogue-contract "$contract" "$@" >"$EXECUTION/$label-process.log" 2>&1 || code=$?
  printf '%s\n' "$code" >"$EXECUTION/$label-exit.txt"
)
```

Execute exactly this order, without overlapping service/display lifecycle work:

| Order / service catalogue | Mode / label | Cache state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Mansfield PAN4/RGB12, development contract | native / `mansfield-native` | uncontrolled-first-observation |
| 2 same service | browser / `mansfield-browser` | warm-server |
| 3 same service | recovery / `mansfield-recovery` | warm-server |
| 4 restart with Boca PAN4/RGB12, validation contract | browser / `boca-browser` | uncontrolled-first-observation |
| 5 same service | recovery / `boca-recovery` | warm-server |
| 6 restart with Tok RGB8 4 + Mansfield RGB16 12 auxiliary, historical contract | browser / `tok-browser` | uncontrolled-first-observation |

For normal rows append `--workload apps/emuella-viewer/real-scene-workload.json
--thresholds apps/emuella-viewer/qualification/real-scene-MODE-thresholds.json`.
For recovery append `--recovery-pressure real-scene-pan-sweep --thresholds
apps/emuella-viewer/qualification/real-scene-pressure-thresholds.json`; omit workload.
Use rebuilt service's existing `serve --representation PATH [--representation PATH]
--listen 127.0.0.1:PORT --verify-payload true --web "$VIEWER_BUILD/web"` route;
pin each delivered catalogue, process ownership and readiness without browser probes.
Retain existing 660-second process deadline, 64-window sweep, 1/4/16 MiB budgets
and seven recovery events. Exactly **3 normal browser launches + 2 recovery
launches / 6 recovery contexts**, and **one native normal journey**. The native
run confirms merged integration under original thresholds; it neither replaces
the observed five-start cohort nor repairs historical resource failures.

Admit each retained trace with `"$BENCH" journey "$EXECUTION/LABEL/composed-trace.json"
THRESHOLDS`, retaining stdout/stderr and exit. One observation supports absolute
results only, following the configured benchmark owner's `docs/composed-journeys.md`
and `docs/comparisons.md`; no repeated statistical speed claim. Count persistent
payload/descriptor/manifest/mask bytes separately from service deltas, actual
`wire.json` TCP application bytes and browser transfer counters. Preflight direct
HTTP lies outside the runner proxy; TCP excludes TCP/IP framing. Preserve failed
and unavailable fields; do not replace measured transport with file sizes.
Revalidate the same input inventories after execution and retain before/after
identities, all exit statuses and owned process termination evidence.

## Inspection, verification and closeout

Main opens inherited `browser-final.png` and recovery final captures; no extra
screenshot run. Record source region and phase/settlement evidence: script completion
alone is not proof every phase settled. Historical native 2/5-second captures can
be intermediate; distinguish them from settled images. Boca has genuine source
mask boundaries; Mansfield/Tok are fully valid and cannot prove boundary handling.
Relate visible regions to native/full-scene and separate browser mask evidence;
neither capture existence nor catalogue delivery proves mask correctness.

Source quality already fails. Tested failed predicates are **diagnostic rejection**;
missing/incomplete proof is **nonterminal**, not an observed pass or rejection of
an untested predicate. Preserve Tok historical detail failures (296.04 > 133.59 ms
native; 334.50 > 168.50 ms browser) unless new corresponding observations pass;
even then retain old results. No configuration selection/acceptance, reserved
validation, ML or human claim. Keep [native](viewer-acceptance-native-cohort-results.md)
and [scheduling](viewer-acceptance-scheduling-results.md) failures unchanged.

Preparation permits syntax, authored no-launch tests and whitespace checks only.
Canonical `cargo xtask verify` is separately main-owned and still required for
delivery. Existing `tools/ui-capture.mjs` creates `.tools/runtime/ui-x11-*`, binds
it over `/tmp` inside bwrap, then recursively removes it. An outer approved alias
is shadowed; even approved `.tools/runtime` backing retains the deletion issue.
The retention option and private mapping below resolve that routing; no canonical
UI edit is assigned here. Do not claim scoped prose verification qualifies this
report. One owner PR can land verified mask/diagnostic implementation; final
merged qualification evidence belongs in the workspace terminal receipt and owner
PR comment, without a recursive owner closeout PR.

## Canonical temporary retention

`POLYORAMA_RETAIN_UI_TEMP=1` leaves the UI capture's owned temporary directory
for caller-managed retention and records `logs/temporary-lifecycle.json`. The
default cleanup behaviour is unchanged. For this campaign, bind fresh approved
backing to the ignored `.tools/runtime` and `.tools/tmp` paths within a private
mount namespace, and enable retention before canonical verification. Confirm
path identities and effective mounts; keep the backing directories afterwards.
The existing inner bwrap mapping then points at that same approved backing.
This setting changes diagnostic-file lifecycle only, not capture, workload,
renderer, comparison or acceptance behaviour. Use already-installed dependencies
and offline package caches; no bootstrap acquisition is authorised.
